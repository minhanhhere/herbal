Herbal Medicine – *master* branch
============================

.. only:: not i18n

  .. note:: Godot's documentation is available in various languages and versions.
            Expand the "Read the Docs" panel at the bottom of the sidebar to see
            the list.

  .. attention:: This is the documentation for the development (master) branch.
                 Looking for the documentation of the current **stable** branch?
                 `Have a look here <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable>`_.

.. only:: i18n

  .. note:: This documentation is translated from the `original English one
            <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest>`_ by community members
            on `Weblate <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/godot-engine/godot-docs>`_.

            Depending on the translation effort's completion level, you may
            find paragraphs or whole pages which are still in English. You can
            help the community by providing new translations or reviewing existing
            ones on Weblate.

            For the time being, localized translations are only available for
            the "latest" (development) branch, but should be suitable to learn
            how to use stable Godot releases nevertheless.

Welcome to the official documentation of `Godot Engine <https://godotengine.org>`__,
